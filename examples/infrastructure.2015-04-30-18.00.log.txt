18:08:18 <nirik> ok, on to discussion
18:08:21 <nirik> #topic What are we going to do about meetbot (whither supybot)? - threebean
18:08:26 * pingou notes that some of these time slot are really late in EU :)
18:08:33 <nirik> pingou: sorry. ;(
18:08:41 <threebean> so, this topic.
18:09:00 <threebean> I only asked to bring it up because it's gotten us into a kind of crossroads.
18:09:14 <threebean> we have zodbot, here, who runs on top of the supybot framework
18:09:24 <threebean> we have a number of plugins for it that we use and depend on around the fedora community
18:09:32 <threebean> notably, meetbot.  that's the software that's used to run this meeting.
18:09:56 <threebean> unfortunately, meetbot is mostly dead upstream.  there's no one maintaining it and there hasn't been a release in a long time.
18:10:04 <nirik> supybot itself is still a bit active, but no releases since 2009. ;(
18:10:23 <threebean> when contemplating what to do about this, pingou started looking into alternative bot frameworks in case we wanted to port away entirely and upgrade to something else
18:10:41 <threebean> namely, 'irc3' which is also written in python (we like) and appears to be nice and modern and maintained.
18:10:42 <pingou> irc3
18:10:58 <nirik> can it do all the stuff supybot does?
18:11:03 * nirik hasn't really looked at it.
18:11:03 <pingou> I have started to port some plugins to it
18:11:11 <pingou> notable the -fedora and koji plugins
18:11:21 <pingou> but larger ones like meetbot would need more work
18:11:23 <nirik> yeah, and aliases are a big use
18:11:57 <threebean> we're kind of at a crossroads with it.  it came up the other day as we were installing 'fedmenu' on all our apps.
18:11:59 <pingou> the plugins themselves are fairly straight forward to write so that's a bonus
18:12:14 <nirik> meetbot might be a fair bit of work to redo?
18:12:14 <threebean> and the meetbot minutes were on the list to update.  it would be quite easy to patch and do.
18:12:44 <threebean> but do we want to fork meetbot and maintain our own copy?  do we waste time with that when we're going to eventually go to irc3.  which way do we go?
18:13:17 <nirik> yeah. We have a lot of history in supybot/supybot-gribble and meetbot, but man it's not very active
18:13:18 <threebean> but, if we never eventually go to irc3, then we're stuck with a meetbot source that we're not tending to when we otherwise could.
18:13:19 <pingou> nirik: meetbot would be some work but not too much, they nicely separated the core logic from the IRC logic
18:13:59 <nirik> I guess I might lean toward moving to irc3 if we are planning on forking meetbot anyhow.
18:14:29 <nirik> but if you like I can try and play with it this week and see if there's anything glaring missing from irc3?
18:14:47 <pingou> the more eyes the better on this, that's for sure
18:15:22 <pingou> one thing I liked about irc3 is its speed, it is quite fast and even if several people are asking questions at the same time, it remains smooth
18:15:23 * dgilmore does not have a strong opinion
18:15:36 <pingou> but I have not looked at other options either
18:15:39 <dgilmore> but actively developed and maintained code seems best
18:15:41 <nirik> moving to a more active upstream sounds appealing.
18:15:58 <pingou> I just met upstream last year at pycon-fr and wanted to play a little bit with the bot
18:16:00 <nirik> how about I try and look at it and we revisit next week/on list? (or anyone else also who wants to)
18:16:15 <threebean> it doesn't seem like we're hampered at all by zodbot's speed atm, though.
18:16:29 <threebean> we're capped at 150 channels, but that's freenode policy, not supybot
18:16:42 <pingou> threebean: kinda when we re-load leave or join :)
18:16:43 <threebean> and the bot is slow to startup, but that's mostly FAS's fault, not supybot.
18:16:44 <nirik> it does take a long time to rejoin
18:16:56 <nirik> the join slowness is supybot
18:17:04 <dgilmore> some of that is freenode flood limitations right?
18:17:18 <nirik> it does some dumb things... like getting info for all users in every channel as it joins them
18:17:24 <nirik> yeah, some of that as well.
18:17:48 <threebean> I don't have a strong opinion about which way we go.  I guess I'd just like us to pick one way so we can cohere development.
18:18:08 * pingou hasn't a strong opinion either
18:18:12 <nirik> are we sure we are going to fork meetbot? is there a list of outstanding requests? or just little stuff?
18:18:29 <threebean> just little stuff.  style.  fedmenu.
18:18:30 <threebean> that's about it.
18:18:32 <nirik> we have added stuff already of course.
18:18:39 <lmacken> we could merge it all into a twisted reactor :)
18:18:55 <lmacken> meetbot + supybot + fedmsg bot
18:19:07 <pingou> lmacken: irc3 uses asyncio
18:19:14 <lmacken> oh sweet :)
18:19:22 <pingou> (and is py3 compatible)
18:19:29 <nirik> ok, let us look for a week and discuss next week/on list? with the idea to decide 'soonish' ?
18:19:41 * nirik would like to look at irc3
18:19:44 <threebean> sounds good to me.  thanks :)
18:20:09 <lmacken> looks like it's the new hotness
18:20:10 <nirik> #action everyone interested to look at irc3 and see if there's functionality that we would have to reimplement
18:20:17 <nirik> #topic Mirrormanager2 status roundup, can we deploy soon? - kevin
18:20:27 <nirik> pingou / adrianr: where do we stand on mm2?
18:20:44 <pingou> so I ported the script creating the fedora-install-X repo to MM2 earlier today
18:20:46 <nirik> I know we needed to get the fedora-install thing in but I saw a script for that go by
18:20:48 <dgilmore> I think it would be good to do it in the next week, or waituntil a week or two after f22 Final GA
18:20:48 <pingou> but it needs testing on stg
18:20:49 <nirik> cool.
18:21:12 <nirik> dgilmore: yeah, I really want to get it done soon, it's lingering. ;)
18:21:14 <pingou> from there, it's a matter of cutting the release and I think we're good :)
18:21:22 <pingou> at least, afaik
18:21:50 <nirik> ok, so test script, cut new release, perhaps look at monday for switch?
18:21:58 <nirik> note that we have some rollback options...
18:22:12 <nirik> ie, if the pkl is not right we can roll back to the mm1 one pretty quickly.
18:22:39 <nirik> and we can keep bapp02 there and making the mm1 pkls until we are sure mm2's are all good.
18:23:01 <pingou> adrianr: seems to be busy until Monday
18:23:12 <pingou> nirik: that sounds good
18:23:21 <pingou> note: tomorrow is holiday in France
18:23:39 <nirik> ok we could do tuesday too... whatever works
18:24:21 <nirik> ok. moving on
18:24:27 <pingou> let's try Monday when the US wakes up and we can always fall back to Tuesday
18:24:32 <nirik> ok.
18:24:37 <dgilmore> sure
18:24:44 <nirik> #action try and migrate to mirrormanager2 monday
18:24:46 <pingou> I'll have the time to cut a release in the morning with the latest stuff :)
18:25:02 <nirik> #topic Convert infra-docs to RST - randomuser
18:25:07 <nirik> randomuser: you around?
18:26:04 <nirik> anyhow, I am fine with doing this... as long as they are still readable after as plain test.
18:26:09 <randomuser> yeah, I'm here
18:26:10 <nirik> which they should be
18:26:31 <randomuser> this is basically a scratch-my-own-itch thing at this point - I want fodder for anerist
18:26:41 * nirik nods.
18:26:45 <randomuser> but, we'll end up with a nice place to display the infra docs
18:27:02 <nirik> I don't think anyone objects. ;) You have a way to just do it, or you need assistance with any of it?
18:27:05 <randomuser> contributor-facing documentation is an end goal
18:27:09 * pingou thinks anitya front-end very hard
18:27:46 <randomuser> I don't have a *programatic* way to do it, but RST is pretty intuitive.
18:27:47 <nirik> pingou: ?
18:28:03 <randomuser> Of course, I won't object to help
18:28:11 <pingou> nirik: we could host the ansible repo in anitya and offers the infra docs under the doc tab of anitya :)
18:28:27 <nirik> ah, right.
18:28:43 <nirik> you mean pagure?
18:28:48 <pingou> oups
18:28:55 <pingou> yes I meant pagure
18:29:14 * pingou digged himself in the hole
18:29:36 <nirik> yeah, I would like to see if we could offer infra ansible there, that would be nice for PR's, etc... but it would have to sync which could be tricky
18:30:08 <dgilmore> speaking of pagure, do we have plans to make it an official provided service?
18:30:31 * randomuser is hoping for production pagure
18:30:33 <pingou> as in ?
18:30:35 <dgilmore> I would like to move all the releng repos to it
18:30:51 <dgilmore> pingou: and in pagure.fedoraproject.org
18:30:54 <nirik> we do I think, but I was waiting for things like it being packaged in epel, etc.
18:31:08 <dgilmore> as in
18:31:26 <pingou> nirik: package is ready but it bundles jquery and therefore does not satisfy the GL
18:31:29 <dgilmore> pingou: I guess to be at teh point we can rely on it being there
18:31:57 <nirik> pingou: ok. ;( I haven't really followed those guidelines...
18:31:59 <pingou> note that we have pagure.org and pagure.io
18:32:36 <nirik> pingou: side note, we have cert for pagure.io now.
18:32:54 <pingou> thanks for that :)
18:33:44 <dgilmore> pingou: and we will keep pagure.org hosted in fedora?
18:33:52 <dgilmore> and it will follow freezes etc?
18:34:07 <pingou> dgilmore: hosted in Fedora yes, folow freeze likely
18:34:26 <nirik> well, if we have release blocking things there, then yeah.
18:34:30 <randomuser> so... infra-docs is sysadmin ACLs, right? I should be able to go for it?
18:34:39 <nirik> randomuser: yep. go for it. ;)
18:34:48 <randomuser> thanks all :)
18:35:57 <nirik> ok, moving on...
18:36:07 <dgilmore> okay. I woudl prefer it under fp.o, but can live with it being in pagure.org
18:36:20 <nirik> #topic Learn about: pkgs.fedoraproject.org, our dist-git server - patrick
18:36:26 <dgilmore> just want to be sure it will be there and not break when doing composes
18:36:53 <nirik> dgilmore: yeah, if we use that for releng, rawhide/branched depend on it every run
18:36:59 <tflink> at one point, I think there was idle talk about using phabricator for some of this - I assume that isn't as much of a possibility anymore?
18:37:15 <pingou> well rawhide will depend on the backend, which is gitolite
18:37:28 <pingou> so just like the current setup
18:37:51 <nirik> pingou: sure. (well, fedorahosted is just git not gitolite, but same difference)
18:37:55 <pingou> tflink: there is a discussion about all the option started by maxamilion on the rel-eng list
18:38:21 <tflink> ah, I just joined that list this week, might have missed the start of it
18:38:45 <dgilmore> pingou: stupid question, could we use pagure on pkgs.fp.o?
18:39:08 <pingou> dgilmore: it would need some adjustements, but we could adjust for it
18:39:32 <dgilmore> pingou: I think it might be nice to allow for people to submit patches
18:39:41 <pingou> things like: integrate the ACLs with pkgdb/ turn off some feature completely (issue, doc)
18:40:04 <dgilmore> pingou: and for allowing people to do private dev etc
18:40:50 <dgilmore> right now we do not allow people to remove branches due to not being sure what commits are used in builds
18:41:21 <dgilmore> maybe making a fork would work around that
18:41:34 <nirik> pingou: didn't you have a proof of concept thing that was like that ? over pkgs?
18:41:54 <pingou> nirik: progite-lite yes
18:42:04 <pingou> but maintaining 2 code bases might not be the best approach
18:42:09 <pingou> (twice the bugs)
18:42:09 <nirik> anyhow, lets perhaps discuss more on list or in other channels?
18:42:12 <pingou> +1
18:42:17 <dgilmore> then we could limit the branches made on the main repos
18:42:21 <nirik> and let puiterwijk do some teaching about pkgs. ;)
18:42:30 <pingou> +1, sorry puiterwijk :)
18:42:34 <dgilmore> nirik: indeed, sorry for the noise
18:42:43 <puiterwijk> Okay, so I had suggested last week someone should do a quick summary of pkgs.fp.o, and seems I somehow agreed to doing this myself, so here we go and see how it goes.
18:43:12 <puiterwijk> So, pkgs.fedoraproject.org, is the server that hosts our git repositories with the spec files for all FEdora packages
18:44:00 <puiterwijk> Those git repos are being created by a script called pkgdb_sync_git_branches, which also creates the branches as the name implies, based on the branches thate exist in pkgdb.
18:44:42 <puiterwijk> the permissions to these repos are being held to by gitolite, which also gets the data for that from pkgdb.
18:45:07 <randomuser> where does this script live?
18:45:12 <puiterwijk> randomuser: in ansible
18:45:16 <randomuser> ack
18:45:17 <puiterwijk> https://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/cgit/ansible.git/tree/roles/distgit/templates/pkgdb_sync_git_branches.py
18:45:36 <puiterwijk> and the script that generates the ACL files for gitolite is located at https://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/cgit/ansible.git/tree/roles/distgit/templates/genacls.pkgdb
18:46:21 <puiterwijk> both of those scripts used to be in a cron job, but these days they're both triggered by fedmsg messages about acl updates and repo/branch creations.
18:46:38 <puiterwijk> that means they are now run pretty soon after a branch request or new package request hasbeen approved.
18:47:52 <puiterwijk> So those git repos hold the spec files and references to tarballs for all builds for all Fedora packages.
18:48:38 <puiterwijk> Since git doesn't handle binary files well, we have a seperate system, called the lookaside cache, where all the actual source tarballs are located
18:49:21 <puiterwijk> The lookaside cache is just an nfs mounted directory on pkgs, where all tarballs are stored, which is served over http to facilitate getting the sources
18:50:16 <puiterwijk> Files are uploaded to lookaside by packagers with fedpkg, and are handled on the server side by a script that computes the hash of the uploaded file, and puts the file in a directory named after the hash of the file
18:51:05 <puiterwijk> That way, it's always possible to find the exact version of the tarball by the checksum, regardless if the next uploaded tarball happens to have the same name.
18:52:41 <puiterwijk> The lookaside upload script is just a small cgi script, hosted by pkgs.fp.o
18:52:57 <pingou> I have a question about the upload.cgi script: do we want to replace it?
18:53:25 <pingou> I mentionned it quickly to threebean iirc, who had some arguments againt (iirc)
18:53:34 <dgilmore> pingou: no opposed to doing so. as long as it does things correctly
18:53:43 <nirik> pingou: well, replace with what? oauth like tokens?
18:53:46 * threebean forgets this
18:53:57 <dgilmore> pingou: but I would think we need a compelling reason to do so
18:54:04 <puiterwijk> pingou: well, I don't really have a reason why we would
18:54:06 <dgilmore> and I am not aware of any
18:54:07 <pingou> nirik: no, just drop-in replacement that does things like: 400 error code when the upload fails :)
18:54:22 <nirik> pingou: ah, so more improve the existing one?
18:54:26 <pingou> or return a 404 if the sources do not exist
18:54:47 <dgilmore> pingou: upload.cgi does not do downloads
18:54:55 <dgilmore> not sure what a 404 would give
18:54:55 <puiterwijk> pingou: downloads are handled by apache directly
18:55:17 <pingou> dgilmore: puiterwijk I know bocecha was looking into it recently and had some problem with that
18:55:28 <pingou> I'd have to ask him the details again, I forgot them
18:55:39 * nirik is open to improvements on it... but they shouldn't break existing tools
18:55:43 <puiterwijk> pingou: well, apache will serve 404's if the requested source doesn't exist
18:55:43 <dgilmore> pingou: okay,
18:55:48 <pingou> so I was wondering if we would want to make it a simple flask app
18:56:08 <pingou> either to debug/maintain in the long term and hopefully behaving more properly
18:56:11 <puiterwijk> pingou: well, I don't think it can be much simpler then the current script, in my opinion
18:56:23 <nirik> seems like more complexity
18:56:28 <puiterwijk> it would end up having a single endpoint with basically the same code, I think
18:56:30 <dgilmore> what we have is very simple
18:56:42 <pingou> puiterwijk: try getting it to run with SElinux w/o our policies and try to figure out why it returns 200 Ok when it fails to write the files :)
18:57:08 <puiterwijk> pingou: so the SELinux stuff wouldn't be solved by flask, that's justbecause of the insanity (in normal cases) of what it's doing
18:57:15 <pingou> after that if you think we don't need it (it's not like we're touching it often anyway), fine for me
18:57:18 <puiterwijk> returning 200 Ok when it fails should be fixed
18:57:27 <pingou> puiterwijk: good luck with that :)
18:57:37 <puiterwijk> sure. last time I looked at the code, I thought it was pretty easy
18:57:49 * nirik notes we have about 3-4min left of our meeting slot. :)
18:58:26 <puiterwijk> pingou: do note that ify you're going to vote to have a flask app handle downloads, I'd be strongly against that: apache handles serving static files better then any flask application could :)
18:58:52 <puiterwijk> (because of the overhead of python and the direct I/O in apache)
18:58:53 <pingou> puiterwijk: not what I proposed/asked :)
18:59:02 <puiterwijk> okay, sure. just wanted to make sure :)
18:59:21 <puiterwijk> are there any other questions about pkgs in the minute w have left? :)
18:59:34 <nirik> thanks puiterwijk. ;)
18:59:44 <nirik> #topic Open floor
